I have taken both the tests. 

1). users-app is for the full-stack test. It has 2 subfolders, client and server. you have to start each folder separately, so cd into each folder and then run 'npm install' and then 'npm start'. This will start the client at http://localhost:8081/ and the server at http://localhost:8000/graphql. Now you can test both the url's on the browser for the results.

2). web-ui is for the front end test. Just cd into web-ui and run 'npm install' and then 'npm start'. This will start the client at http://localhost:8080/. You can test this url on the browser to see the result.
